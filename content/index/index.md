# Presentation
Johan has always had a great interest in computers and first began programming at the age of twelve. He often has a few software projects going on, and a constant hunger for learning more and improving his craftsmanship.

Johan has substantial experience from working with several different types of systems, with Kotlin, Java, the Spring Framework and Kafka being his core competence. He has worked with business-critical software, such as core software-components in the automotive industry, financial systems and governmental systems. He has worked on and designed cutting edge microservice architectures, as well as maintained and improved ten-year-old Java monoliths. Recently he has discovered the joy of modern front-end development, having some experience in Javascript and frameworks, as well as data visualization using d3.js. He always strives to work test-driven, and apart from unit testing, he has also worked with and created end-to-end test suites and load tests. No matter the project, he strongly believes that code must be clean and clear. Code quality, readability, robustness, testing and well thought-through solutions are keywords in Johan’s deliveries.

Johan has held presentations and coding dojos for team members. He has taken the initiative to introduce new tools to the technology stack, and to improve the team’s way of working. Software is always built by people for people, and to understand the problems that are to be solved as well as the interactions between those who build the solution, is something Johan believes is very important. Most problems and complications arise from inadequate communication.

As a person, Johan is social and outgoing. He is driven by creative joy and takes on challenges with passion. Tasks exist in order to be solved and processes to be simplified!
