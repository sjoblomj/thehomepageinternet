# Vehicle Service Core

The Volvo vehicles constantly send a large amount of data to the Volvo Telematics systems. The Vehicle Service Core is one of the first systems in the architecture that receive data, and the systems there were responsible for among other things enriching the data by communicating with other services and routing messages to consumers.

The systems in the Vehicle Service Core were a mixture of a monolith and micro-services. Johan added new features and performed maintenance, and helped with support and deployment. He took the initiative and responsibility for conducting load tests for a component in a restricted environment and wrote a parser that extracted log data and illustrated it in Grafana graphs. The results were vital in finding several important configuration issues.
