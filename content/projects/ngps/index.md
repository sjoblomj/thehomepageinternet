# NGPS

Enterprise system for fleet management and reports, written in ECMAScript 6 with React and React Boilerplate.

The NGPS project was a web front end for management of Volvo trucks and heavy-duty vehicles, such as excavators, graders, articulated haulers and the like. The application gave users modern means of fleet management, allowed for tracking of vehicles on a map and fetched data about vehicles, drivers and assets for display. The application was intended to be used for mobile, tablets and desktop and to be used in locations with bad or even no Internet connection.

Johan was part of the project during its initial phase and contributed to and took responsibility for its core parts. He worked with features such as searching, filtering, routing and design.

The application was written in React and ECMAScript. Many of the latest technologies were used, with [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) as a base, which included projects such as Redux (state container), Hot Reloading (instant results on save), Babel (transpiling Javascript dialects), react-router (keeping URLs in sync with the UI), Offline First (making sure Internet access is not required) and redux-saga (side effect management).
