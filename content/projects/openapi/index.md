# OpenApi Generator

OpenApi Generator allows generation of API client libraries, server stubs, documentation and configuration from a specification file. It is widely used in numerous projects and organisations all over the world.

I have made several contributions to the Kotlin part of the project. The most substantial one is to introduce support for a different annotation library (swagger2) and a documentation provider (springdoc), in addition to the ones already present. This was an improvement that was much asked for by the community, since the previous libraries were deprecated or unmaintained.

In addition I also made several bug-fixes to the codebase.
