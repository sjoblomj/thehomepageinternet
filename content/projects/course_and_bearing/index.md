# Course and Bearing

A [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) PDF diagram for nautical Course and Bearing. Created when taking a Coastal Yachtmaster Diploma (sv: Kustskepparintyg, de: Küstenschifferschein).

The nomenclature and terms are my best effort, and may be somewhat erroneous.

Compile it with `pdflatex course_and_bearing.tex`. To use Swedish nomenclature, set `\\newcommand{\\useenglish}{false}` in the course_and_bearing.tex file.

The diagram is created in LaTeX with the tikz library. {{github |repo=course_and_bearing}}
